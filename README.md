# MOO
Masters of Operational Oceanography (MOO) (RU) (coding work) 
This repository contains all coding work done throughout the Rutgers Master's of Operational Oceanography program. Within this repository, I will provide coding work from summer workshops, code from working with different departments of DMCS, assignments specifically from the program, and any code I used for my thesis. Most, if not all, of the code will be in Python Jupyter notebooks. The process of coding and environment setup is recommended setup from the MOO program.

The summer workshop's code will be limited as my device, containing all of my code setup, was not backed up properly, and all data was lost when the device malfunctioned. However, all data that I do still have will be uploaded. This section will include coding assignments related to Python fundamentals, pandas, xarray, cartopy, and my final project. Each section, excluding the final project, will have multiple notebooks attached. My final project ties into my thesis work by plotting device information from the YUCO micro AUV.

Code related to shadowing work from the different departments of DMCS will include work from the high-frequency radar team. In this section, there will be two notable coding assignments looking a surface currents. One will focus on eddy accumulation data for ne region, and the second will be looking at time series of many regions.

The coding work related to the program will range widely and have notebooks dedicated to ocean modeling, climate modeling, and glider missions. There will be descriptive titles and notes for each notebook, and what the code aims to do.

My thesis project aims to create a method for mapping seagrass assemblages through side-scan sonar classification. This thesis works more with the specific sonar software. The final section will include any code used for my thesis. As of 4/28/25, there is no work to be added to this section. I will update this once/if I have coding to add for this section.
